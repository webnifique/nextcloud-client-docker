This image is based on the work made by: [Martin Peters](https://github.com/FreakyBytes)

## Example using local folder

    docker run -it --rm \
      -v $(pwd)/sync-folder:/media/nextcloud \
      -e NC_USER=$username -e NC_PASS=$password \
      -e NC_URL=$server_url\
      juanitomint/nextcloud-client

## Example using local folder and exclude settings. You have to place a "exclude" file and a "unsyncfolders" file into one directory and mount it into the docker container

    docker run -it --rm \
      -v $(pwd)/sync-folder:/media/nextcloud \
      -v /path/to/settingsfolder:/settings \
      -e NC_USER=$username -e NC_PASS=$password \
      -e NC_URL=$server_url\
      juanitomint/nextcloud-client

## Example for the file "exclude" in the settings folder

    file1
    file2

## Example for the file "unsyncfolders" in the settings folder

    folder1
    folder2

## Example using a [named volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)

    docker run -it --rm \
      -v some_named_volume:/media/nextcloud \
      -e NC_USER=$username -e NC_PASS=$password \
      -e NC_URL=$server_url\
      juanitomint/nextcloud-client

## Example one time run

    docker run -it --rm \
      -v some_named_volume:/media/nextcloud \
      -e NC_USER=$username -e NC_PASS=$password \
      -e NC_URL=$server_url\
      -e NC_EXIT=true\
      juanitomint/nextcloud-client



replace:
 * $username
 * $password 
 * $server_url 
 
 with valid values for an existing and valid user on a Nextcloud Server.
